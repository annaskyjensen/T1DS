# Type 1 Diabetes Simulator

Deus Ex Machina: creating a virtual patient to aid in type 1 diabetes research.

A [Bachelors Project](https://www.makeareadme.com/) created by Anna and Caroline.

We propose the transformation of a static simulator to a “real-time” one that can better test the boundaries of these technologies, as well as provide intuitive and useful results to researchers. As a result of using agile techniques, the product will also be easily modifiable to allow for innovation.
